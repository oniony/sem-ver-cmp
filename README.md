SEM.VER.CMP

# Overview

SEM.VER.CMP compares [semantic version](https://semver.org/) numbers.

Handy for comparing versions in continuous integration (CI) scripts, &c.

# Features

* [X] Compare two semantic version numbers withoun suffixes
* [ ] Support for label suffixes
* [ ] Validate a single semantic version number
* [ ] Ranges
    - [ ] Partial versions, e.g. v1.2 contains v1.2.3
    - [ ] Explicit ranges, e.g. v1.2.0..v1.2.5 contains v1.2.3
* [ ] Other operations
    - [ ] Sort set of versions
    - [ ] Get maximum/minimum of set of versions

# Compilation

* Install Rust from <https://www.rust-lang.org/>
* Build SEM.VER.CMP:

    $ git clone git@github.com:oniony/semvercmp.git
    $ cd semvercmp
    $ cargo build
    
# Usage

## Compare Two Versions

```sh
semvercmp LEFT RIGHT 
```

LEFT and RIGHT are semantic versions with or without `v` prefix.

Prints text to standard output to indicate the relationship between LEFT and RIGHT:

* `less`: LEFT is less than RIGHT
* `equal`: LEFT and RIGHT are equal
* `greater`: LEFT is greater than RIGHT

Returns an error code if either version is invalid.

### Examples

```
$ semvercmp v1.2.3 v1.2.5
less
$ semvercmp 4.5.10 4.5.1
greater
```
